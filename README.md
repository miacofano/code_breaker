[Updates planned for 2023]
1 - complete answer entry verification.  If the user types an answer that is not an available option or miss spelled it will relay an error message and allow user to guess again.
2 - add a pop up window with a visualization of the guesses and game progress.
3 - add a leaderboard for each level (user enters name after completion).
4 - add user log in.  this will eliminate the need to enter name after completion and will allow the user to keep track of their own record.
